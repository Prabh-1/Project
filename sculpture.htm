                <p>
                    Sculpture, an artistic form in which hard or plastic materials are worked into three-dimensional art objects. The designs may be embodied in freestanding objects, in reliefs on surfaces, or in environments ranging from tableaux to contexts that envelop the spectator. An enormous variety of media may be used, including clay, wax, stone, metal, fabric, glass, wood, plaster, rubber, and random “found” objects. Materials may be carved, modeled, molded, cast, wrought, welded, sewn, assembled, or otherwise shaped and combined.

                    Types of Sculptures

                        <li><dt>Relief Sculpture:</dt></li>
                        <dd>Relief sculptures are created on a flat surface and have varying degrees of depth. The sculpted forms emerge from the background but are still attached to it. There are three main types of relief sculptures: low relief (bas-relief), where the sculpted elements are slightly raised from the surface; high relief, where the elements are deeply raised and stand out prominently; and sunken relief (intaglio), where the sculpted elements are carved into the surface.</dd>
                        <li><dt>Free-Standing Sculpture:</dt></li>
                        <dd>Free-standing sculptures, also known as "in-the-round" sculptures, are three-dimensional artworks that are meant to be viewed from all angles. They are not attached to any surface and can be seen in their entirety.</dd>
                        <li><dt>Figurative Sculpture:</dt></li>
                        <dd>Figurative sculptures represent the human form or figures. They can range from realistic and lifelike representations to abstract or stylized forms.</dd>
                        <li><dt>Abstract Sculpture</dt></li>
                        <dd>Abstract sculptures do not attempt to represent the natural world realistically. Instead, they focus on shapes, lines, and forms to convey emotions, ideas, or aesthetics.</dd>
                        <li><dt>Kinetic Sculpture:</dt></li>
                        <dd>Kinetic sculptures are artworks that incorporate movement. They are often powered by motors, wind, or other mechanisms, allowing them to change and shift their appearance over time.</dd>

                    Different Mediums Used for Sculpture
                </h1>
                <ul>
                    <dl>
                        <li><dt>Clay:</dt></li>
                        <dd>Clay is one of the most traditional and versatile sculpting mediums. It allows artists to work with their hands and create intricate details. Fired clay sculptures can be preserved permanently, while non-fired clay sculptures may be cast in other materials.</dd>
                        <li><dt>Stone:</dt></li>
                        <dd>Stone carving involves sculpting solid blocks of stone, such as marble, granite, limestone, and soapstone. It requires skill and precision to chisel away the unwanted material and reveal the desired form.</dd>
                        <li><dt>Wood:</dt></li>
                        <dd>Wood carving is another ancient sculpting medium. Artists use various tools, such as chisels and knives, to carve and shape wood into sculptures.</dd>
                        <li><dt>Metal:</dt></li>
                        <dd>Metal sculptures can be created through welding, forging, casting, and other metalworking techniques. Common metals used for sculptures include bronze, steel, aluminum, and copper.</dd>
                        <li><dt>Bronze:</dt></li>
                        <dd>Bronze casting is a method where a sculpture is initially created in another material (usually clay or wax), and then a mold is made from the original. Molten bronze is poured into the mold, resulting in a bronze sculpture.</dd>
                        <li><dt>Plaster:</dt></li>
                        <dd>Plaster is used for modeling and creating molds for casting sculptures. Artists can sculpt directly with plaster or use it to create a model for later casting.</dd>
                        <li><dt>Resin:</dt></li>
                        <dd>Resin is a material commonly used for casting sculptures. It can be combined with various additives and dyes to create detailed and durable sculptures.</dd>
                        <li><dt>Ceramic:</dt></li>
                        <dd>Ceramic sculptures are made from clay that is fired in a kiln, resulting in a durable and often glazed artwork.</dd>
                        <li><dt>Glass:</dt></li>
                        <dd>Glass sculptures involve shaping and manipulating molten glass through various glassblowing or casting techniques.</dd>
